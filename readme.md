There are two scripts here. CoSMaps-PSAW searches the subreddit for any post with the word 'map' in the title or any post with the 'map' flair. CoSMaps-GenerateDoc.py generates a .docx file that plays well with the desired CoS wiki format.

I developed this in python 3.8 and ran it on Spyder. If you need help with running the script or python in general, I recommend the python Discord https://pythondiscord.com/
